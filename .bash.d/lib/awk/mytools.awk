# confirmed against this system's actual /usr/bin/awk (mawk 1.3.4) that
# its interval-expression support is broken for this pattern -- it
# matched a docstring line with only 5 dash/equals characters scattered
# across it, nowhere near 10 consecutive, silently mis-detecting it as a
# new category header. The anchored form needs no interval syntax at all
# and is also a more precise match on what a real separator line actually
# looks like (the *entire* line, not just some run within it).
