# Note: `gh` is intentionally absent from APT_DEPENDENCIES and
# COMPLEX_DEPENDENCIES. On apt-based systems it needs GitHub's own repo/
# keyring added first, which bootstrap() already does directly at the end
# of its run -- listing it here too would just produce a failed plain
# `apt-get install gh` followed by a misleading "needs manual config"
# warning for something that gets installed correctly a few lines later
# regardless. It stays in BREW_DEPENDENCIES since Homebrew's own `gh`
# formula needs no special repo setup.
